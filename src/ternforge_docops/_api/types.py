"""Public vocabulary types for ternforge docops.

Why:
    Provides the stable home for caller-facing names such as modes, categories,
    providers, states, operation kinds, request DTOs, and response DTOs.

How:
    Add public vocabulary here only when callers should depend on those names.
    Do not expose private implementation literals as public enums.
